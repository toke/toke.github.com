# Or how this site is updated

This site is build via [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
and the sources are coming from a git repository on
[github](http://github.com). I do
not write something special about git or jekyll here. Just how the
"deployment" works.

## Github webhook
Github has a nice feature called "Service hooks" - especially a
"Post-Receive URLs" hook. I use this hook to notify my server to
do a "git pull" on a local repository, then rebuild the site with
jekyll and rsync changed data to the document root.

The update itself is done by this little shellscript:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1781256.js"> </script>

To be continued...
